# Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones
<b>(Recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of
daily living)</b>


In an experiment with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19 to
48 years, each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS,
WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The experiments have been video-recorded
to label the data manually.
